After about 3 weeks of working on tracking down manuals and schematics the two Mikes were able to successfully assemble and power up the behemoth Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) that was donated to the Space by Santa Barbara Infrared. This puts the SB Hackerspace into a small exclusive group of maker spaces which have electron microscopes for use by members and the public.  We are planning on sharing all the technical docs and steps on this blog soon.</p>

<p>In the mean time, here are some photos of this amazing machine in action.</p>
